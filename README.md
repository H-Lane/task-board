# Employee Payroll-Tracker

Week 5 Challenge - Create an employee payroll tracker using JavaScript.

## Description

The purpose of this project was to create a kanban style task board with drag and drop, deleteable, and day-based coloration functionality. I created this project to apply all of my current coding knowledge in a realistic setting, especially using javascript to store object to local storage and use them to populate dynamically created elements on my page. Through this project I have learned many different third party API syntaxes and their functionality. I have also gained considerable comfortability with passing parameters to various functions within my code.
